## Troubleshooting
- **Icons Not Loading?**
  - Check if `react-icons` is properly installed: `npm install react-icons`
  - Verify your imports are correct (e.g., `import { FaGithub } from 'react-icons/fa'`)
  - Make sure you're using valid icon names from the latest version

- **Performance Issues?**
  - Import only the icons you need instead of entire icon sets
  - Consider using lazy loading for icon sets
  - Implement pagination if displaying large numbers of icons

- **Styling Problems?**
  - Icons can be styled using standard CSS properties
  - Use the `size` prop for quick resizing: `<FaGithub size={24} />`
  - Custom colors can be applied via the `color` prop

## Extended Features
